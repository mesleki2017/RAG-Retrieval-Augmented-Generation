**Understanding the Requirement:** When building a Retrieval Augmented Generation ( #RAG ) app that operates entirely offline, you need a solution that can generate sentence #embedding s without an internet connection.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Pre-trained Models:** The model should be #pre-trained on a large corpus of text to capture #semantic relationships effectively.
- **Offline Capability:** The model and its dependencies must be self-contained and not require external resources.
- **Performance:** The model should be efficient enough to provide timely responses in an offline environment.
