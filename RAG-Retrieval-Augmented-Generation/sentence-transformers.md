No, `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` is not a local file by default. It is the name of a pre-trained model hosted by the `sentence-transformers` library, which is built on top of the `transformers` library by Hugging Face.

### How it Works:
When you use the command:

```python
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
```

### What Happens?
1. **Model Download**:
   - If this is the first time you are loading this model, the `SentenceTransformer` class will automatically download the model from Hugging Face's model hub to your local cache directory (usually in `~/.cache/torch/` or a similar location on your system).

2. **Local Storage**:
   - Once downloaded, the model is stored locally on your machine. Subsequent uses of this model will load it from the local cache rather than downloading it again.

### Offline Usage:
- **If you need to work fully offline**: Once the model is downloaded, you can use it without an internet connection. If you want to ensure that the model is always available locally (even without an initial download), you could manually download the model files and specify a local path when loading the model.

### Loading from a Local Directory:
If you want to ensure the model is loaded from a specific local directory, you can do so like this:

```python
model = SentenceTransformer('/path/to/local/model_directory')
```

In this case, `/path/to/local/model_directory` should contain the files for the `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` model.

### Summary:
- `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` is a pre-trained model name.
- It is downloaded automatically from Hugging Face when you first use it.
- It is stored locally after the first download and can be used offline.
- You can specify a local directory if you want to control where the model is loaded from.
