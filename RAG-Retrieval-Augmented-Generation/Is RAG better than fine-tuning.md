RAG is generally better for most enterprise use cases because it is more secure, scalable, and cost-efficient. It allows for enhanced security and data privacy, reduces compute resource costs, and provides trustworthy results by pulling from the latest curated datasets.

### What is the difference between rag and fine-tuning vs prompt engineering?

RAG involves augmenting an LLM with access to a dynamic, curated database to improve outputs, while fine-tuning involves training an LLM on a smaller, specialized dataset to adjust its parameters for specific tasks. Prompt engineering involves crafting queries to elicit better responses from the model without altering the model or its data sources.

### Can rag and fine-tuning be used together?

Yes, RAG and fine-tuning can be used together. While fine-tuning trains the model to better understand specific tasks, RAG ensures the model has access to the most relevant and up-to-date data. Combining both methods can enhance the performance and reliability of the model.

### Is rag cheaper than fine-tuning?

RAG is generally more cost-efficient than fine-tuning because it limits resource costs by leveraging existing data and eliminating the need for extensive training stages. Fine-tuning requires significant time and compute power for training the model with new data, making it more resource-intensive.

### What is the difference between rag and model fine-tuning?

RAG involves augmenting an LLM with access to a curated database, allowing it to retrieve relevant information dynamically for generating responses. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, involves adjusting the model’s parameters by training it on a specific, labeled dataset to improve its performance on specific tasks. Fine-tuning modifies the model itself, while RAG enhances the data the model can access.

### When to use rag vs fine-tuning?

Use RAG when you need a scalable, secure, and cost-efficient solution for integrating up-to-date and reliable information into LLM outputs. Use fine-tuning when you need the model to perform better on specific tasks by training it on a specialized dataset.

### What is the difference between rag, fine-tuning, and embedding?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) connects an LLM to a curated database to improve outputs by integrating reliable information. Fine-tuning adjusts the model’s parameters by training it on a specialized dataset to improve performance on specific tasks. Embedding involves representing data in a lower-dimensional space to capture semantic relationships, used to enhance the model’s understanding of context and meaning.
