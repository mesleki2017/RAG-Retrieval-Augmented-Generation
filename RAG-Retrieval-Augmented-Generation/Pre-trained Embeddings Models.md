Both LangChain and LlamaIndex leverage #pre-trained language models (LLMs) to enhance their capabilities. Here's a list of popular pre-trained models commonly used with these frameworks:

### LangChain

- **Hugging Face Transformers:** A vast library of pre-trained models, including BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and more. #Hugging 
- **OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4:** Powerful generative language models with extensive capabilities.
- **Cohere:** A commercial LLM provider offering various models for different tasks.
- **AI21 Labs:** Another commercial LLM provider with models like Jurassic-1.

### LlamaIndex

- **Hugging Face Transformers:** #Hugging Similar to LangChain, LlamaIndex can utilize models from this library.
- **LLaMA:** A Meta AI-developed LLM that is often used as a base for fine-tuning.
- **Vicuna:** A community-driven LLM trained on a large dataset of instruction-following conversations.

**Note:** The choice of pre-trained model often depends on factors such as task requirements, computational resources, and desired performance. Some models may be more suitable for specific tasks like question answering, summarization, or translation
