#embedding 
**Embeddings** are numerical representations of text that capture its semantic meaning. Essentially, they transform text into a dense, real-valued vector.

**Imagine a word like "cat."** An embedding for this word might be a vector of numbers like [0.23, 0.15, -0.37, ...]. This vector doesn't represent the literal characters of the word, but rather its contextual meaning. Similar words, like "dog" or "kitten," would have embeddings that are close to each other in vector space, indicating their semantic similarity.

**Why is this useful?**

- **Similarity:** Embeddings allow us to measure how similar two pieces of text are.
- **Machine Learning:** Many machine learning algorithms work with numerical data, so embeddings make text data suitable for these models.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Embeddings can help machines understand the meaning and context of text.

**How are embeddings created?** There are several methods to create embeddings, including:

- **Word2Vec:** A popular method that learns word embeddings from a large corpus of text.
- **GloVe:** Another popular method that uses co-occurrence statistics to learn word embeddings.
- **BERT:** A more recent method that uses a transformer architecture to learn contextual embeddings.

**In summary**, embeddings provide a powerful way to represent text as numerical vectors, enabling machines to understand and process natural language effectively.
