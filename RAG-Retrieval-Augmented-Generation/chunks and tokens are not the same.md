- **Tokens:** The smallest units of text that are meaningful in a language. They can be words, punctuation marks, or even subwords (in some cases). For example, in the sentence "The cat sat on the mat.", the tokens would be "The", "cat", "sat", "on", "the", and "mat".
    #tokens #chunk 
- **Chunks:** Larger units of text, typically consisting of multiple tokens. Chunks can be phrases, sentences, or even paragraphs. For example, in the same sentence, "The cat sat on the mat" could be a chunk. However, "The cat" or "on the mat" could also be considered chunks, depending on the context and the specific task.
    

**In summary,** tokens are the building blocks of sentences, while chunks are groups of tokens. The choice of whether to use tokens or chunks often depends on the specific task and the desired level of granularity.
