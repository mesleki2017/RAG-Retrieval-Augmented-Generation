#Ollama offers a variety of pre-trained models for different tasks. Here are some examples:

**Text-based models:**

- **nomic-embed-text**: Designed for general text #embedding.
- **nomic-embed-code**: Optimized for code embedding.
- **nomic-embed-text-qa**: Suitable for question-answering tasks.
- **nomic-embed-text-semantic**: Focused on capturing semantic relationships.
- **nomic-summarize**: Trained for text summarization.
- **nomic-translate**: Capable of translating text between languages.

**Image-based models:**

- **nomic-embed-image**: Designed for image embedding.
- **nomic-generate-image**: Capable of generating images from text descriptions.

**Other models:**

- **nomic-chat**: A conversational AI model.
- **nomic-code-completion**: A code completion model.
- **nomic-write-email**: A model for writing emails.

This is not an exhaustive list, and Ollama may introduce new models over time. You can find more information on Ollama's website or by exploring their API documentation.




**`OllamaEmbeddings(model="nomic-embed-text")` does not directly use Hugging Face embeddings.**

Ollama is a separate platform that provides its own pre-trained models, including "nomic-embed-text". While Ollama might use Hugging Face models as a building block or for inspiration, the "nomic-embed-text" model is likely trained and optimized specifically within the #Ollama ecosystem.

**To use Hugging Face embeddings**, you would typically need to import the `transformers` library and load a specific model from #Hugging Face's model repository.


- **OllamaEmbeddings:** Uses Ollama's own pre-trained models.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings:** Requires direct loading and usage of Hugging Face models.

The choice between using Ollama or Hugging Face embeddings depends on your specific needs, preferences, and the desired level of control over the embedding process.
